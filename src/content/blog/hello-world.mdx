# Hello World!

This is my first blog post using **MDX**. 

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, like interactive charts or notifications, and export metadata.

### Features

- **Write markdown** and use **React components** in the same document
- **Import components** and use them right in your markdown
- **Export metadata** like title, date, etc.

```javascript
// Example code block
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

> MDX is really powerful for content-heavy sites!
