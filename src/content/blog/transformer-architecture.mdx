# Understanding Transformer Architecture in NLP

The Transformer architecture has revolutionized natural language processing since its introduction in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017.

## Key Components

### Self-Attention Mechanism

The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding a specific word, regardless of their positions.

### Multi-Head Attention

Multiple attention mechanisms run in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously.

### Positional Encoding

Since transformers process all words simultaneously (unlike RNNs), positional encodings are added to give the model information about word positions.

## Applications

- **BERT**: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
- **GPT**: Generative Pre-trained Transformer
- **T5**: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer

## Code Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, heads):
        super(SelfAttention, self).__init__()
        self.embed_size = embed_size
        self.heads = heads
        self.head_dim = embed_size // heads
        
        assert (self.head_dim * heads == embed_size), "Embed size needs to be divisible by heads"
        
        # Define the linear layers for queries, keys, and values
        self.values = nn.Linear(self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=False)
        self.keys = nn.Linear(self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=False)
        self.queries = nn.Linear(self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=False)
        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(heads * self.head_dim, embed_size)
```

The transformer architecture continues to be the foundation for most state-of-the-art models in NLP today.
